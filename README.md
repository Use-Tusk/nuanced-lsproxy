## <a name="what-is-lsproxy">What is lsproxy?</a>

`lsproxy` offers a simple containerized REST API for project-wide code analysis and navigation using Language Servers:
  - find sybmol definitions across files
  - find symbol references across files
  - code diagnostics/lints (coming soon)
  - call and type hierarchies (coming soon)
  - procedural refactors (coming soon)

Language servers are powerful, but tricky to use outside of IDEs.
- Each programming language has its own server implementations that need to be installed and started up separately.
- These servers have bespoke configuration and undocumented behaviors.
- Different server implementations support different features of the protocol.
- The protocol is designed around cursors and raw text.

`lsproxy` aims to solve this by:
- Pre-installing servers for popular languages and running them automatically based on your project files.
- Automatically detecting configuration and providing sensible defaults.
- Offering a streamlined API to use with AI coding assistants and other clients.
- Providing a consistent experience across different languages.
    

## <a name="getting-started">Getting started</a>
The easiest way to get started is to run it yourself! We keep the latest version up to date on docker hub, and we have a python SDK available via `pip`. If you need additional inspiration for how this can be helpful to you, check out the [Examples](#examples) section.

### Install the sdk

You can find the documentation for the SDK [here](sdk.agenticlabs.com)
```bash
pip install lsproxy
```

### Run a container or add to compose
Make sure your `WORKSPACE_PATH` is an absolute path, otherwise docker will complain.
```bash
docker run -p 4444:4444 -v $WORKSPACE_PATH:/mnt/workspace agenticlabs/lsproxy
```

```dockerfile
services:
  lsproxy:
    image: agenticlabs/lsproxy
    ports:
      - "4444:4444"
    volumes:
      - ${WORKSPACE_PATH}:/mnt/workspace
```

### Explore your workspace!

```python
from lsproxy_sdk import Lsproxy

client = Lsproxy()
file_path = "relative/path/from/language/root.cpp"
symbols = client.file_symbols(file_path)
for symbol in symbols:
    print(f"{symbol.name} is defined in {file_path}")
```

## <a name="examples">Examples</a>
Most have you spin up a `lsproxy` docker container with your own code above and then just run the python script we provide, but we provide sample code for a few examples. See the README for each one for more info.
